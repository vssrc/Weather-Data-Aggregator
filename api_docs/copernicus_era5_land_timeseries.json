{"title":"ERA5 Land hourly time-series data from 1950 to present","description":"ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to the \nFifth Generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis (ERA5).\nProduced by replaying only the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis, it benefits from the same physical data-assimilation framework but runs offline at \nhigher spatial detail (9 km grid) to deliver richer land-surface information. \nReanalysis merges numerical model output with global observations into a globally complete, physically consistent climate record; \nthis “data assimilation” approach mirrors operational weather forecasting but is optimised for historical completeness rather than forecast timeliness.\nReanalysis datasets extend back several decades by sacrificing forecast deadlines, allowing additional time to gather observations and retrospectively ingest improved data, \nthereby enhancing data quality in earlier periods.\nERA5-Land uses atmospheric fields from ERA5—air temperature, humidity, pressure—as “forcing” inputs to drive its land-surface model, \npreventing rapid drift from reality that unconstrained simulations would suffer.\n Although observations do not enter the land model directly, they shape the atmospheric forcing through assimilation, giving ERA5-Land an indirect observational anchor.\n To reconcile ERA5’s coarser grid with ERA5-Land’s finer 9 km grid, a lapse-rate correction adjusts input temperatures, humidity, and pressures for altitude differences.\nLike all numerical simulations, ERA5-Land carries uncertainty that generally grows backward in time as fewer observations were available to constrain the forcing.\n Users can combine ERA5-Land fields with the uncertainty estimates from equivalent ERA5 variables to assess confidence bounds.\nThe temporal resolution (hourly) and spatial detail (9 km) of ERA5-Land make it invaluable for land-surface applications such as flood and drought forecasting, \nagricultural monitoring, and hydrological studies.\nThe dataset presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5-Land archive, stored in an Analysis-Ready, \nCloud-Optimised (ARCO) format specifically designed for retrieving long time-series for individual points. \nWhen a user’s requested location does not exactly match a grid point, the nearest grid point is automatically selected. This optimised data source ensures rapid response times.","id":"reanalysis-era5-land-timeseries","version":"1.0.0","jobControlOptions":["async-execute"],"outputTransmission":["reference"],"links":[{"href":"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-era5-land-timeseries","rel":"self"},{"href":"https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/retrieve/v1/processes/reanalysis-era5-land-timeseries/execution","rel":"execute","type":"application/json","title":"process execution"}],"inputs":{"variable":{"title":"Variable","schema":{"type":"array","items":{"enum":["10m_u_component_of_wind","10m_v_component_of_wind","2m_dewpoint_temperature","2m_temperature","skin_temperature","snow_cover","soil_temperature_level_1","soil_temperature_level_2","soil_temperature_level_3","soil_temperature_level_4","surface_pressure","surface_solar_radiation_downwards","surface_thermal_radiation_downwards","total_precipitation","volumetric_soil_water_level_1","volumetric_soil_water_level_2","volumetric_soil_water_level_3","volumetric_soil_water_level_4"],"type":"string"}}},"data_format":{"title":"Data format","schema":{"enum":["csv","netcdf"],"type":"string"}}},"outputs":{"asset":{"title":"Asset","description":"Downloadable asset description","schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"value":{"title":"FileInfoModel","required":["type","href","file:checksum","file:size","file:local_path"],"type":"object","properties":{"type":{"title":"Type","type":"string"},"href":{"title":"Href","type":"string"},"file:checksum":{"title":"File:Checksum","type":"string"},"file:size":{"title":"File:Size","type":"integer"},"file:local_path":{"title":"File:Local Path","type":"string"}}}}}}}}
